so (yet again) the other day, it was around 2am... i was programming on mobile data (cuz my mother unplugged the wifi that night) and i was using **EE Stay Connected** (which was slow as HELL). just to make a simple web search on any search engine, it would take around 5 minutes to load the page. so i thought to myself, "why not make a search engine that's super lightweight and fast?" and that's how i started making my own "search engine".

so i started by scraping DuckDuckGo with a library called `duck-duck-scrape`. i then made a simple html page using **bun** and **elysia's jsx plugin** (god i love bun) with a search bar and a list of search results. i then added a little bit of css to make it look nice and voil√†! i had my own search engine.

i later added an actual main page which was just a heading and input lmao... this is actually a pretty fun project to work on, and would also make a fun started project for anyone who wants to get into web/backend development.

anyways i hope i can update this blog some more.... au revoir :3
